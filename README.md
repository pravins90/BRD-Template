Business Requirement Document
Business Requirement Document (BRD) designed to streamline the project initiation process. The BRD is first sent to the requestor, who fills in critical details such as the Project Objective and Scope. After the requestor completes their part, the user then provides additional information, including the Project Start date and ETA.
